NQueensSolverSA
===============

Solver for the fully-expanded N-Queens problem using simulated annealing technique

It's based on the specifications and recommendations shown in the following paper:

“Comparison of Heuristic Algorithms for the N-Queen Problem”, Martinjak and Gloub, 2007

Also the Collision detection distance as well as the Random swap techniques are implemented as the paper suggests. 
Feel free to tweak the Alpha (rate of decay), Max Iterations and startig Temperature in order to tweak the results.

If you find this useful and stumble across me, buy me a beer; I'd really appriciate that!
